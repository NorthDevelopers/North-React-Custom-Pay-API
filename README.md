# Securely Embed Payments in a ReactJS App

This is a Java application that uses the front-end React framework to demonstrate an embedded payment solution with [North's Custom Pay API](https://developer.north.com/products/full-featured/custom-pay-api). The code in this repository handles the front-end payment process and adds a simple payment form to a website. The code that handles back-end part of the payment process is located in a [separate repository](https://github.com/NorthDevelopers/North-Java-Custom-Pay-API), allowing each to be deployed separately.

## Get Sandbox Credentials

To get started, create a free [North Developer Portal account](https://developer.north.com/register). This will allow you to get the sandbox credentials that are required to test the app. Log in to your account to view the official [Custom Pay API Integration Guide](https://developer.north.com/products/full-featured/custom-pay-api/integration-guide), then [contact](https://developer.north.com/contact) North's Sales Engineering team to get sandbox credentials added to your Developer Portal account.
